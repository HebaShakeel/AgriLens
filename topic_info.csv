Growing a cherry tree from a seed or pit is not difficult, but pollination your tree and completing the winter chill needs can be challenging. Cherry trees require eight hours of sunlight each day and a pH of 6.5 to 6.7 in well-drained soil. Is it true that cherry trees produce fruit every year? Cherry trees do not bear fruit all of the time. It takes several years for young cherry trees to grow enough to provide fruit.']"

The biggest problem with BVD is when a naive breeding female is infected in the first 120 days of gestation, leading to the birth of a persistently infected (PI) calf. A PI can appear normal but shed the virus throughout their lives, and will always give birth to another PI. ""The vaccination is safe in pregnancy, but the cornerstone of successful BVD vaccination is vaccinating pre-breeding to give foetal protection,"" Mr Eastham says.', 'The Detail Thomas Elder Markets (TEM), with the support of Zoetis Australia, have been investigating the impact of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV), also known as Pestivirus, on the Australian cattle sector and this piece is the second in a series of articles on Pestivirus that will focus upon: What the virus is, how widely it is distributed and how it is spread (Published 14 th October) October) The impact of the virus on cattle, types of infected animals, implications for breeding and current control measures The economic cost of the virus, impacts to the beef feedlot and dairy sector The international response to the virus and the consideration of a control/eradication program for Australia Impact of Pestivirus on non-pregnant cattle Susceptible cattle that are exposed to Pestivirus and become transiently infected (TI) can face a variety of negative impacts, dependent upon the type of cattle they are, before they recover from the virus and become immune.']"

One can raise a rabbit as a pet and grow it in a small land without much investment. Rabbits have been reared in our country for a long time. There are many benefits to commercial rabbit farming.

Until recently, farming was largely a rural activity.

Urban agriculture is about producing food within city limits. It has challenges, but it also offers many benefits such as increased food security, reduced waste, community involvement, and more.', 'It is however recommended that a favourable urban agriculture policy should be included in the urban development policy and a plain structured architectural plans for enhancement of urban agriculture practice in Nigeria.', 'Introduction to urban agriculture in Canada: Urban agriculture is a place where people cultivate food in and around urban areas.
