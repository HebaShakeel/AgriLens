Sales of bare development land by sole traders and business partners normally incur a CGT liability at 10% on gains up to the higher-rate income tax threshold of 50,271 and 20% thereafter. However, where housing has already been built, the higher CGT rates for residential property apply (18% for lower-rate taxpayers and 28% for higher rates).', 'Farming families could soon be facing a potential tax hike as the government looks at possible changes to Capital Gains Tax. Many farmers can potentially pass on farms to their children free from Inheritance Tax due to Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief. As capital gains are wiped away on death, children inheriting can sell and only face Capital Gains Tax on any rise in value between the date of death and the sale. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered a review into this, and the Office of Tax Simplification has issued recommendations.', ""To qualify, new assets need to be bought within three years of selling the old ones, the business must be trading at the point of both sale and purchase, and both assets must be used in a trading business. Other pitfalls Development land may not always be sold within a landowner's lifetime, which raises issues with inheritance tax reliefs. When it comes to farmland and property, agricultural property relief will only apply to the agricultural value of land. All value above this may be exposed to inheritance tax at 40%, unless business property relief applies.""]"

Black gram is filled with magnesium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, and calcium. These all minerals strengthen your bone mineral density. Is Black gram a Kharif crop? During the Kharif season, the Black gram is cultivated throughout the country.', 'Plants also need good sunlight and a good drainage system for good growth. Clay or loam soils are suitable for growing Black Gram, but soil pH should be neutral.

Seeds used for sowing should be adequate for the good field. Seeds should be thoroughly inspected and free from pests, insects, and diseases.
